# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains my personal data related works that includes state-of-art data science, data cleaning, data manipulation, machine learning, statistical tests, as well as, financial analysis and crypto bot projects. This works are completed in frame of academic studies, real-life projects and hobby interests.
The tools utilized for this projects are mostly jupyter lab, but also includes further tools, e.g. Tableau. 

### Tools
  - **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Scipy, Statsmodels
  - **Data Visualization**: Tableau
  - **Crypto Trading**: gate_api, binance
  - **Financial Analysis**: Mplfinance

## Contents
- ## Data Collection, Merging and Data Cleaning (Jupyter-Python)
    - [Mobility Change during COVID19](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data-collection-merging-and-cleaning/mobility-dataframe-preparation.ipynb): In this work, Google Mobility Data, GDP per capita, weather data, COVID19 case records, city development index, traffic congestion index, fuel prices are collected, all dataframes are cleaned and merged in a single dataframe. 
    - [Data Cleaning with Human-Intelligence](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data-collection-merging-and-cleaning/data-cleaning-for-hr-classification.ipynb): This work contains various data cleaning methods, as well as, data imputation with ML algorithms. The importance of manual data cleaning and filling missing values for saving valuable data and maintaining bias of data is explained with a real-world case study.
    - [Financial Analysis](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/test.ipynb): It will be uploaded soon.

- ## Data Visualization (Jupyter-Python)
    - [COVID19 vs Mobility Data Visualization](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data-visualization-python-jupyter/mobility-data-analysis-visualization.ipynb): Mobility during COVID19 pandemy is visualized in Jupyter-Notebook to get better first insight of the data. In this work mobility change is analyzed considering locations, well-being, number of cases and similar records, weather, traffic and so on.
    
   
- ## Data Visualization (Tableau)
    - [COVID19 Mobility Evaluation](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data-visualization-tableau/data-visualization-tableau.ipynb): Mobility during COVID19 pandemy is visualized with Tableau to get better first insight of the data. In this work mobility change is analyzed considering locations, well-being, number of cases and similar records, weather, traffic and so on.
    
- ## Machine Learning (Jupyter-Python)
    - [Regression Analysis](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/test.ipynb): It will be uploaded soon. 
    - [Classification](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/test.ipynb): It will be uploaded soon. 
    - [Clustering Countries by COVID19 Mobility Behaviour](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/machine-learning/mobility-cluster.ipynb): The countries are clustered with KMeans and DBScan by their mobility behaviour to draw meaningful insights. 

     
- ## Statistical Analysis (Jupyter-Python)
    - [Statistical Analysis of COVID19 Mobility](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/statistical-analysis/mobility-statistical-tests.ipynb): The relationships between weather, city and county development index and mobility behaviour are analyzed using Shapiro, Levene, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis H and Dunn tests. 
    
- ## Financial Analysis, Technical Indicators (Jupyter-Python)
    - [Technical Indicators for Financial Analysis](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/test.ipynb): It will be uploaded soon. 
    - [Crypto Trading Bot for Binance](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/test.ipynb): It will be uploaded soon.
    - [Crypto Trading Bot for Gate.io](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/test.ipynb): It will be uploaded soon.
