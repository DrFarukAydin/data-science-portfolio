## Contents
- ## Data Collection, Merging and Data Cleaning (Jupyter-Python)
    - [Mobility Change during COVID19](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data-collection-merging-and-cleaning/mobility-dataframe-preparation.ipynb): In this work, Google Mobility Data, GDP per capita, weather data, COVID19 case records, city development index, traffic congestion index, fuel prices are collected, all dataframes are cleaned and merged in a single dataframe. 
    - [Data Cleaning with Human-Intelligence](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data-collection-merging-and-cleaning/data-cleaning-for-hr-classification.ipynb): This work contains various data cleaning methods, as well as, data imputation with ML algorithms. The importance of manual data cleaning and filling missing values for saving valuable data and maintaining bias of data is explained with a real-world case study.
    - [Data Visualization for Financial Analysis](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/financial-tools/data-visualization-finance.ipynb): Candlesticks visualization with MPLFinance with Supertrend and MOST indicators, as well as, RSI.

- ## Data Visualization (Jupyter-Python)
    - [COVID19 vs Mobility Data Visualization](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data-visualization-python-jupyter/mobility-data-analysis-visualization.ipynb): Mobility during COVID19 pandemy is visualized in Jupyter-Notebook to get better first insight of the data. In this work mobility change is analyzed considering locations, well-being, number of cases and similar records, weather, traffic and so on.
    
   
- ## Data Visualization (Tableau)
    - [COVID19 Mobility Evaluation](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data-visualization-tableau/data-visualization-tableau.ipynb): Mobility during COVID19 pandemy is visualized with Tableau to get better first insight of the data. In this work mobility change is analyzed considering locations, well-being, number of cases and similar records, weather, traffic and so on.
    
- ## Machine Learning (Jupyter-Python)
    - [Regression Analysis: Wind Turbine Energy Output Prediction ](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/machine-learning/regression-wind-turbine.ipynb): To predict energy output, various imputation (LGBM Imputer, KNNImputer, etc.) and train-test split (StratifiedKFold) methods applied with various Regressors (ElasticNet, KNN Regressor, SVM, MLP Regressor (Neural Network), Decision Tree, Bagging, RandomForest, ADABoost, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, LGBM and CatBoost Regressors). 
    - [Classification for Human Resources](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/machine-learning/classification-hr.ipynb): In this work, some state-of-art classification algorithms are performed to decide which candidates looking for a job change. Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNeighbors, SVC, Neural Network (MLP), DecisionTreeClassifier, Random Forests, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and Perceptron algorithms are created and tuned using RandomizedSearchCV. The results are compared to find the best algorithm for this particular dataset. Furthermore, the most effective features for the target value are evaluated. 
    - [Clustering Countries by COVID19 Mobility Behaviour](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/machine-learning/mobility-cluster.ipynb): The countries are clustered with KMeans and DBScan by their mobility behaviour to draw meaningful insights. 

     
- ## Statistical Analysis (Jupyter-Python)
    - [Statistical Analysis of COVID19 Mobility](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/statistical-analysis/mobility-statistical-tests.ipynb): The relationships between weather, city and county development index and mobility behaviour are analyzed using Shapiro, Levene, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis H and Dunn tests. 
    
- ## Financial Analysis, Technical Indicators (Jupyter-Python)
    - [Crypto Trading Bot for Binance](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/financial-tools/binance-bot.ipynb): Creating a trader bot that can automatically buy/sell crypto on Binance.
    - [Crypto Trading Bot for Gate.io](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/financial-tools/gate-io-bot.ipynb): Creating a trader bot that can automatically buy/sell crypto on Gate.io.
    - [Technical Indicators for Financial Analysis](https://github.com/DrFarukAydin/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/financial-tools/technical-indicators-finance.ipynb): Functions for technical indicators, i.e., SuperTrend, MOST (Moving Stop Loss), RSI.
